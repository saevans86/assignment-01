Working on refactoring HTML and CSS to optimize SEO

My motivation when starting the project was to make the code look easy to read and as simple as possible. We were given a base code for our first week assignment to re-factor an existing code for a marketing agency (Horiseon), to make the web page more accessible. The tasks required were to try and follow the semantic structure of the CSS code as well as consolidate the selectors and properties while maintaining the appearance of the original web page. 

After reading more about semantic coding and watching some videos, I found that using div/span codes is typically used as a last resort. I updated the div codes using nav/section to seperate the header/links only to find out later on I'd made a mistake in the marketing agencies' branding for their header logo which led me to using a span code, since I couldn't find a reference showing how to seperate them in CSS, but still trying to figure out if it's possible. I was able to consolidate different class selectors by grouping elements that shared the same element structure in the web page and reducing the length of the file and appeared cleaner to me.
